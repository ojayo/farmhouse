This is a simple static website showing a hyperlinked set of architectural drawings. I created all the design documents myself and publish them here under a Creative Commons BY-SA license. Unlike most claims concerning open-source architecture, you can really build a functional house from these drawings.

I'm very new to programming and this is my first attempt at creating a useful website from scratch. I doubt it is responsive and it probably could be much better, but I hope it is interesting and useful regardless of my lousy craftsmanship.
